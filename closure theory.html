**What is a closure?

A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer 
(enclosing) function’s variables — a scope chain.

The closure has three scope chains:

it has access to its own scope — variables defined between its curly brackets
it has access to the outer function’s variables
it has access to the global variables

JavaScript Function Scope

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

**In JavaScript there are two types of scope:

Local scope
Global scope
JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.

Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.

Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.

**Local JavaScript Variables

Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.

Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the function.

**Global JavaScript Variables

A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.

A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it.
